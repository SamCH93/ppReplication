#' @title ppRep: Bayesian design and analysis of replication studies using power
#'     priors
#'
#' @description The ppRep package features methods for design and analysis of
#'     replication studies using power priors assuming normality. Power priors
#'     are a useful class of informative prior distributions that allow to
#'     incorporate the data from the original study in the analysis of the
#'     replication data.
